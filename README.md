# Tip-Adapter: Training-free Adaption of CLIP for Few-shot Classification
Official implementation of ['Tip-Adapter: Training-free Adaption of CLIP for Few-shot Classification'](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09519.pdf).

The paper has been accepted by **ECCV 2022**.
## Introduction

Tip-Adapter is a training-free adaption method for CLIP to conduct few-shot classification, which not only inherits the training-free advantage of zero-shot CLIP but also performs comparably to those training-required approaches. Tip-Adapter constructs the adapter via a key-value cache model from the few-shot training set, and updates the prior knowledge encoded in CLIP by feature retrieval. On top of that, the performance of Tip-Adapter can be further boosted to be state-of-the-art by fine-tuning the cache model for only 10x fewer epochs than existing approaches, which is both effective and efficient.

## Requirements
### Installation
Create a conda environment and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gaopengcuhk/Tip-Adapter.git
cd Tip-Adapter

conda create -n tip_adapter python=3.7
conda activate tip_adapter

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the according versions of torch and torchvision
conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit
```

### Dataset
Follow [DATASET.md](https://github.com/gaopengcuhk/Tip-Adapter/blob/main/DATASET.md) to install ImageNet and other 10 datasets referring to CoOp.

## Get Started
### Configs
The running configurations can be modified in `configs/dataset.yaml`, including shot numbers, visual encoders, and hyperparamters. 

For simplicity, we provide the hyperparamters achieving the overall best performance on 1\~16 shots for a dataset, which accord with the scores reported in the paper. If respectively tuned for different shot numbers, the 1\~16-shot performance can be further improved. You can edit the `search_scale`, `search_step`, `init_beta` and `init_alpha` for fine-grained tuning.

Note that the default `load_cache` and `load_pre_feat` are `False` for the first running, which will store the cache model and val/test features in `configs/dataset/`. For later running, they can be set as `True` for faster hyperparamters tuning.

### Numerical Results
We provide Tip-Adapter's **numerical results** in Figure 4 and 5 of the paper at [exp.log](https://github.com/gaopengcuhk/Tip-Adapter/blob/main/exp.log).

TODO: Add CLIP-Adapter's numerical results for comparison.

### Running
For ImageNet dataset:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main_imagenet.py --config configs/imagenet.yaml
```
For other 10 datasets:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --config configs/dataset.yaml
```
The fine-tuning of Tip-Adapter-F will be automatically conducted after the training-free Tip-Adapter.
